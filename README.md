A clean and minimal signup form built to demonstrate API integration, user accessibility, and simple form setup. I created this project specifically to highlight my ability to pull in external API data and apply accessible HTML form patterns, keeping the focus on some minor but significant fundamentals I have not yet added to any larger projects. The form uses the REST Countries API to dynamically populate the country dropdown, relies on semantic labels and inputs for accessibility, and is built entirely with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Get Started:**  
You can view the live version here: (https://CpreCS.github.io/Signup-Form-API-Integration/)  

**If you want to run it locally:**
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser.


**Purpose of This Project:**  
This project wasn’t made as a learning exercise or as a deep technical challenge. It was intentionally kept simple so it could demonstrate a few specific concepts clearly:

API Integration Using a Web API:
- I already have a project that uses local JSON data, so I wanted another example that shows I can pull data from an external API, handle it, sort it, and generate DOM elements from it. Using live country data from the REST Countries API keeps the example small while still proving real API-handling experience.

Basic Form Structure & Accessibility:
- The rest of my projects cover UI, layout, responsiveness, or interactivity, but I didn’t have anything that focused specifically on clean, accessible form patterns. This project fills that gap by showing proper labels, input types, required fields, and native browser validation.

Minimal, Focused Implementation:
- This project isn’t meant to be complex or feature-heavy.
- Its purpose is to clearly demonstrate API integration, accessible markup, and basic form establishment.

Everything else is intentionally kept simple so the main concepts are easy to see.
